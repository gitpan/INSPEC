INSPEC service through AXIOM corp. visit http://axiom.iop.org/ to see if your 
institution has a subscription.

Only works with BibTeX databases.. so far.

INSTALLATION

This module is written entirely in Perl. There's nothing to build, and 
installation should be as simple as

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

To install this module by hand, simply copy retriever.pm and bibtex.pm to the 
\perl\lib\INSPEC directory.

You must make one small change to getCite.pl:

open getCite.pl with an editor and find the following line
$INSPEC::Retriever::AXIOM_code = "ARKAN" ; # ...

You must change "ARKAN" to the code for your institution. To find your 
insitutions code, visit http://axiom.iop.org/ and hit the Access Axiom -> 
Standard Service link. Look at the URL in your browser. At the U of A the URL 
looks like: http://axiom.iop.org/S/ARKAN/search . Your's will not contain ARKAN 
but some other code. Replace ARKAN with whatever your code is in the getcite.pl 
line above and save getcite.pl. You are all set.


USAGE

This is a command line tool. To add a reference to your database you need to 
know three pieces of information:

The CODEN or ISSN for the journal
The volume number
The starting page number

A CODEN is designation assigned to a periodical title by the Chemical Abstracts 
Service. Each CODEN consists of four mnemonic letters and a fifth letter, A, B, 
C, or D. The sixth character, a check character, is alphabetic or numeric. To 
find the CODEN of the journal you are interested in you can check the journal or 
search for it through AXIOM.

To add Physical Review Letters (CODEN=PRLTAO), Volume 83 Page 2989 to your 
bibtex file called mybib.bib. You would type the following

getcite PRLTAO 83 2989 --b mybib.bib
